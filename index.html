 We show that several GFP-like proteins' fluorescence can be modulated by small magnetic fields in the presence of specific cofactors. We identify FMN and Cinnavalininate as small metabolite cofactors for mScarlet, and FAD, Hydroxykynurenine, 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid and Cinnavalininate as cofactors for EGFP. We also show that magnetic field modulation of fluorescence can be achieved in biological contexts like mammalian cells using a FlavinTag fused to EGFP and co-expression of a flavin transferase. We expect that with further engineering, the <em>in vivo</em> compatibility of the effect will open the door to countless applications like resolution enhancement, imaging in scattering samples, single color multiplexing, optically detected magnetic resonance, and maybe even magneto-genetics. (optically detected electron spin resonance)

Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Proteins that interact strongly with electromagnetic fields give us incredible power to reveal and control biology. This “toolbox” is especially mature at optical frequencies, built from a small set of ancestral proteins that evolved to respond to light (e.g. opsins, the LOV domain, GFP)

<p>
Unfortunately, mammals are optically opaque, and optogenetic tools only work in our most superficial tissues. We’re exquisitely transparent at DC or RF frequencies, but the “magnetogenetic toolbox” isn’t just immature - it’s nonexistent. Are there ancestral proteins that respond strongly to low-frequency electromagnetic fields? If so, can we engineer these ancestors, and expand the optogenetic revolution beyond yeast, worms and cells, into a <em>magnetogenetic</em> toolbox for flies, mice, dogs - and humans? A candidate ancestor for our toolbox must be robustly electromagnetically responsive in nontoxic body-temperature liquid water, and this response must control downstream (opto)genetic machinery. 
</p>
<p>
We first considered the cryptochrome / photolyase family (CRY/PHL)
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4124" title="Cryptochromes: Photochemical and structural insight into magnetoreception; Karki, N., Vergish, S., &amp; Zoltowski, B. D.; Protein science 105, 1521–1534 (2021)">Karki 2021</a>], 
but found that they fail badly as candidate ancestors. For example, CRY fluorescence is magnetoresponsive 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2447" title="Chemical amplification of magnetic field effects relevant to avian magnetoreception; Kattnig, D.R., Evans, E.W., Déjean, V., Dodson, C.A., Wallace, M.I., Mackenzie, S.R., Timmel, C.R. &amp; Hore, P.J.; Nature Chemistry 8 384-391 (2016)">Kattnig 2016</a>,
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SC01986K" title="Detection of magnetic field effects by confocal microscopy; Déjean, V., Konowalczyk, M., Gravell, J., Golesworthy, M.

perhaps CRY could act as a magnetically-actuated FRET-based "gate" between a luminescent protein and an optogenetic tool 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.09.531939" title="Engineered allostery in light-regulated LOV-Turbo enables precise spatiotemporal control of proximity labeling in living cells; Lee, S., Cheah, J.S., Zhao, B., Xu, C., Roh, H., Kim, C.K., Cho, K.F., Udeshi, N.D., Carr, S.A., &amp; Ting, A.Y.; bioRxiv 2023.03.09.531939 (2023).">Lee 2023</a>]
. Unfortunately, this magnetoeffect is small (0.05% - 0.75%), and CRY is at least a thousandfold(!) dimmer than GFP. Transient absorption of CRY/PHL is also magnetoresponsive 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1118959109" title="Magnetically sensitive light-induced reactions in cryptochrome are consistent with its proposed role as a magnetoreceptor; Maeda, K., Robinson, A.

J.; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 109, 4774–4779 (2012)">Maeda 2012</a>], 
but we don’t see how transient absorption can control downstream machinery. Furthermore, these effects seem to require some combination of near-freezing temperatures and toxic conditions (e.g. potassium ferricyanide). CRY conformation and dimerization is optically responsive 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1524" title="Rapid blue-light–mediated induction of protein interactions in living cells; Kennedy, M.J., Hughes, R.M., Peteya, L.A., Schwartz, J.W., Ehlers, M.D. &amp; Tucker, L.C.; Nature Methods 7, 973–975 (2010)">Kennedy 2010</a>], 
but to our knowledge, this has never been controlled with a magnetic field, and we suspect this is not for lack of trying.
</p>
<p>
We feared the magnetoresponse of organic molecules might be inherently weak - after all, the decoupling of spin from a molecule's electronic, vibrational, rotational, or conformational dynamics is what makes MRI so powerful. We were therefore shocked to find a paper
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/nl202950h" title="Mapping Nanomagnetic Fields Using a Radical Pair Reaction; Lee, H., Yang, N. &amp; Cohen, A.E.; Nano Letters 11, 5367-5372 (2011)">Lee 2011</a>]
that showed a staggering ~80% change in a simple organic fluorophore’s brightness, in response to a handheld magnet, at room temperature!

This powerful, robust magnetofluorescent response could easily control downstream optogenetic machinery via FRET. Unfortunately, the fluorophore doesn't work in aqueous solvent. Nonetheless, we were inspired - maybe no protein displays this physics, but it’s not insane to hope one <em>could</em>. 
</p>


<p>Perhaps CRY/PHL's weak, fragile magnetoresponse is unique, and we should begin the daunting process of engineering them into more robust magnetogenetic tools. However, if protein magnetoresponse is common but simply underappreciated, we could save countless years of engineering effort by finding a better starting point. Inspired by Lee <em>et al</em>'s demonstration of powerful magnetofluorescent response, we decided to look for magnetoresponse from the family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_fluorescent_protein&oldid=1143612679">GFP</a>-like fluorescent proteins. GFP is arguably the single most-studied, most-engineered, and most-used protein known to science. If we can build magnetogenetics from the foundation of GFP, we immediately connect to a vast body of existing knowledge, experience, and innovation.
</p>

<p>
But does GFP respond in any way to magnetic fields? To our surpise and delight, it does. 
</p>


<h3>
Results
</h3>
<h4>
The fluorescence intensity of EGFP responds to magnetic fields in <em>E. coli</em>
</h4>

<p>
We first noticed magnetofluorescent response from <em>E. coli</em> expressing <a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/egfp/">EGFP</a>, using a <a href="./appendix.html#appendix">simple epifluorescence microscope</a> with a servomotor-mounted magnet above the sample. The fluorescent brightness varied slightly but unmistakably as the field alternated from ambient to ~10 mT. Of course, delightful but unexpected results are almost always artifacts, so we began <a href="./appendix.html#debugging">debugging</a>.
</p>

<p>
Pure proteins are simpler to debug than bacteria, but to our surprise, when we <a href="./appendix.html#sample_prep">purified</a> the EGFP, the magnetofluorescent effect disappeared (<a href="#EGFP_cartoon" target="_self">Figure 1</a> with <code>Sample: EGFP alone</code> selected). Neither purified EGFP nor EGFP-negative bacterial lysate displayed measurable magnetofluorescence, but mixing the two restored the effect. Filtering &lt;7 kDa molecules out of the lysate eliminated magnetoresponse, so we suspected some small molecule(s) in the lysate were acting as cofactors for EGFP magnetofluorescence.
</p>

<p>
On a hunch, we screened a variety of metals, metabolites, and vitamins as potential cofactors for EGFP magnetoresponse. After a long string of negative results, we finally found a weak hit from an EGFP/riboflavin mixture, which inspired us to try other (more soluble) flavins. A mixture of purified EGFP and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) yielded an exciting result: the EGFP fluorescence intensity varied by ~1% in response to a ~10 mT field, in room-temperature, nontoxic <a href="./appendix.html#exp_design">aqueous buffer</a>! (<a href="#EGFP_cartoon" target="_self">Figure 1</a> with <code>Sample: EGFP plus FAD photoproduct in vitro</code> selected).
</p>

<h4>
EGFP-FlavinTag: a candidate ancestor for the magnetogenetic toolbox
</h4>

<p>
FAD is an ideal cofactor for our purposes. Flavins aren't just nontoxic - they're ubiquitous, already present in most cells and tissues. Even better, we can use the FlavinTag system 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00306" title="Flavin-tag: A Facile Method for Site-Specific Labeling of Proteins with a Flavin Fluorophore; Tong, Y., Lee, M., Drenth, J., &amp; Fraaije, M. W.; Bioconjugate chemistry 32, 1559–1563 (2021)">Tong 2021</a>]
 to <a href="./appendix.html#sequences">covalently bind</a> flavin to EGFP, producing a simple genetically-expressed biocompatible magnetically-controlled fluorescent molecule (Figure 1 with <code>EGFP-FlavinTag in E. coli</code> selected). From an engineering perspective, this is an excellent candidate ancestor for magnetogenetic tools: a bright, nontoxic, environmentally robust fluorophore suitable for controlling downstream optogenetic machinery via FRET, building on the vast and mature body of GFP-related technology. The intensity modulation (~0.25% at ~10 mT) is much weaker than we'd prefer, but our construct is completely unoptimized for magnetic response, and 
 [<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/nl202950h" title="Mapping Nanomagnetic Fields Using a Radical Pair Reaction; Lee, H., Yang, N. &amp; Cohen, A.E.; Nano Letters 11, 5367-5372 (2011)">Lee 2011</a>]
  gives us hope that this could improve substantially with further engineering.

  We imaged EGFP bound to agarose Ni-NTA beads in the presence and absence of 1 mM FAD through a 540 nm emission filter. The increased magnetic field, where the fluorescence goes down more rapidly, are highlighted on the graph using dark grey vertical shading. Neither EGFP or FAD alone show a response to the changes in magnetic field that happen every 5 seconds (drop-down menu). In contrast, the EGFP/FAD mixture decreases fluorescence as the magnetic field is increased.

<p>
EGFP-FlavinTag is magnetoresponsive <em>in vitro</em>, and enzymatic <a href="./appendix.html#EGFP_TEV_figure">removal of the FlavinTag</a> eliminates the magnetoresponse as expected. As shown in Figure 1, EGFP-FlavinTag fluorescence is also magnetoresponsive in living bacteria. Note that while <em>E. coli</em> lysate inspired our discovery of EGFP/flavin magnetofluorescence, this does not mean that flavin was the (only) cofactor in the lysate; we suspect there are additional cofactors in <em>E. coli</em> that we have yet to discover.
</p>

<p>
Flavins are also the cryptochrome (magneto)fluorescent cofactor. This is highly suggestive, but we don't <em>need</em> flavin; we found several other small molecules which yield magnetofluorescent response when mixed with EGFP. As shown in Figure 1 for various choices of <code>Sample:</code>, hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, cinnavalininate, and the tetrazoleum viability stain WST-8 all function as EGFP magnetofluorescence cofactors <em>in vitro</em>, although we find them less convenient than flavin. None of these cofactors yield measurable magnetoresponse in the absence of EGFP (e.g. Figure 1 with <code>Sample: FAD alone</code>), nor does FAD mixed with a <a href="./appendix.html#EGFP_beads_control_figure">non-fluorescent EGFP &#8710;Y66 mutant</a>. We don't know how to predict which molecules will work as magnetofluorescence cofactors, but even our limited observations share features: small molecules with one or more aromatic rings that participate in electron transfer and/or tryptophan metabolism

Our ultimate goal is to enable magnetogenetics in mammals, so we tested EGFP-FlavinTag in cultured mammalian cells. As illustrated conceptually in Figure 2, the <a href="./appendix.html#sample_prep_mam">setup</a> is similar to our <em>E. coli</em> work, except now the EGFP-FlavinTag is expressed in COS7 cells, and targeted to the interior of the mitochondria via a COX8A sequence.

<p>
The GFP family is fluorescent in a remarkably wide range of conditions, which is crucial for their utility. Nonetheless, the detailed fluorescent properties of the GFP family (e.g. brightness, lifetime, bleaching/switching rates) depend on their environment (e.g. pH, oxygen concentration, temperature) in a rich, complex way. We assume the magnetoresponse of EGFP-FlavinTag also depends on its environment in a rich and complex way, but it must retain at least some magnetoresponse in mammalian cells to be useful for our purposes.
</p>

The magnetoresponse in COS7 cells (Figure 2) is clearly different from <em>E. coli</em> (Figure 1), but magnetoresponse is clearly present.  We suspect the magnitude of the magnetoresponse could be enhanced by extra flavin, perhaps via coexpression of FAD synthase

Traditionally, GFP's environmental dependence is either minimized via engineering to yield tags, or accentuated and/or characterized to yield biosensors. We expect both approaches will be similarly fruitful for magnetoresponsive proteins like EGFP-FlavinTag.
For now, though, we're simply happy that it seems to work at all, in mammalian cells.

<h4>
Magnetoresponse may be a generic feature of GFP-like fluorescent proteins
</h4>
<p>
We observed at least some <a href="./appendix.html#coli_figure">magnetoresponse in <em>E. coli</em></a> from several other GFP-like fluorescent proteins, including <a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mvenus/">mVenus</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2019.04.014">tdVenus</a>, <a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/dsred/">dsRed</a>, and <a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mscarlet/">mScarlet</a>. From a scientific perspective, magnetoresponse seems far more common than we expected, which raises countless questions beyond the scope of this manuscript. What is the mechanism of magnetoresponse? What aspects of each fluorophore determine its magnetoresponsive behavior? What are the physical limits on this reponse? From an engineering perspective, our diverse starting points show the hallmark of evolvability: magnetoresponse is neither insensitive to, nor intolerant of minor modifications (GFP&rarr;mVenus) and major modifications (GFP&rarr;mScarlet) to the protein sequence. We also hope that a diverse palette of absorption/emission colors will allow us to (eventually) connect a wide range of chemiluminescent donors to a wide range of optogenetic acceptors via a magnetoresponsive BRET-acceptor/FRET-donor intermediate

Purified mScarlet yields the largest protein magnetoresponse we've observed, almost 3% when mixed with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photoproduct <em>in vitro</em>, as shown conceptually (Figure 3) and quantitatively (Figure 4) below. mScarlet is arguably the best red fluorescent protein ever engineered, so we're especially excited that such a promising foundation yields such a large magnetoresponse

We also expect red fluorophores like mScarlet will be especially important for magnetogenetics with external illumination or emission, because red light typically penetrates better in translucent tissues. </p>

Like EGFP, we also found non-flavin small molecules which yield magnetofluorescent response when mixed with mScarlet. As illustrated in Figure 3 and shown in Figure 4 for various choices of <code>Sample:</code>, cinnavalininate and WST-8 function as mScarlet magnetofluorescence cofactors <em>in vitro</em>. None of its cofactors yield measurable magnetoresponse in the absence of mScarlet, nor does purified mScarlet in the absence of a cofactor (e.g. Figure 4 with <code>Sample: 500 &mu;M FMN alone...</code> and <code>Sample: mScarlet alone...</code>). Interestingly, several cofactors that yield EGFP magnetoresponse don't seem to work with mScarlet (FAD, hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid), nor does FMN yield measurable magnetoresponse when mixed with EGFP. Neither mScarlet-FlavinTag nor FlavinTag-mScarlet fusions showed measurable magnetoresponse, but we intend to keep trying (e.g. by varying the FlavinTag linker). In contrast, EGFP-FlavinTag worked on our first try, but we suspect we just got lucky. We have no model to explain any of these observations, but we hope some of our readers are qualified and inspired to tackle the many questions raised here.
</p>

<p>
Unlike EGFP, the excitation/emission spectrum of mScarlet is substantially different from flavin, which gives us a convenient way to dissect the photophysics of flavin cofactors a bit more. Cyan illumination (~470 &plusmn; 12 nm) preferentially excites flavin, while green illumination (~550 &plusmn; 7.5 nm) preferentially excites mScarlet, and our emission filter (705 &plusmn 36 nm) preferentially transmits mScarlet's emission. As shown below, this suggests that a long-lived photoproduct of cyan-illuminated FMN is the magnetofluorescent cofactor for mScarlet, rather than FMN itself.

  <strong>Figure 6: mScarlet protein fluorescence responds to magnetic fields in the presence of FMN if pre-irradiated with 470 nm light.</strong> mScarlet bound to agarose Ni-NTA beads was imaged in the presence and absence of 500 &mu;M FMN through a 700 nm emission filter. During the first ~75 seconds, the sample was irradiated with 470 nm light (green shaded background, <em>'mScarlet + FMN with 470 nm pre-excitation'</em> selected) or not irradiated at all (white shaded background, <em>'mScarlet + FMN without 470 nm pre-excitation'</em> selected). After 75 seconds, the sample was imaged continuously with 550 nm excitation (red shaded background). mScarlet alone, FMN alone, and mScarlet + FMN without 470 nm excitation fluorescence show no response to the changes in magnetic field that happen every 5 seconds throught the whole experiment. In contrast, mScarlet + FMN with 470 nm pre-excitation displays changes in fluorescence, which last for several minutes after 470 nM irradiation stops.

<p>
Our non-flavin cofactors don't require cyan illumination to yield mScarlet magnetoresponse, nor does mScarlet in <em>E. coli</em>. However, purified mScarlet mixed with FMN yields almost ~3% magnetofluorescent response in the green/red channel (550 nm excitation, 705 nm emission), <strong>if and only if</strong> it's pre-illuminated with cyan light (Figure 4 with <code>Sample: mScarlet + 500 &mu;M FMN with/without 470 nm pre-excitation</code>). There is measurable fluorescence but no apparent magnetoresponse in the cyan/red channel during pre-illumination (470 nm excitation, 705 nm emission). Green/red-channel magnetoresponse still occurs even if several minutes elapse between cyan illumination and green/red-channel interrogation, suggesting a long-lived cyan-generated photoproduct. We suspect the cyan-generated photoproduct is from FMN rather than mScarlet, based on their absorption spectra, and we tenatively spectulate that the long-lived state is an FMN radical. We suspect that similar photophysics occurs for EGFP-FlavinTag and EGFP/FAD mixtures, but the overlapping EGFP/flavin absorption/emission spectra obscure this dynamic.

We observed small but unmistakable magnetoresponse in <em>E. coli</em> from the LOV-family protein <a href="./appendix.html#sequences">AsLOV C450A V416T</a>

This was the first (and only) LOV-family protein we checked, so we were quite surprised to get such an easy "hit" from essentially a shot in the dark.

Remarkably, we've found magnetoresponse in every family of fluorescent proteins we've checked so far (CRY, GFP, and LOV). The CRY/PHL family is arguably the most well-known and well-studied magnetoresponsive fluorophore, but in our hands, also the weakest. From a scientific perspective, this raises fascinating questions. Are most (all?) fluorescent proteins magnetoresponsive, given the right cofactor(s)? If so, why has the field focused almost exclusively on CRY as the putative origin of animal magnetosensation? Are proteins generally magnetoresponsive, but we only notice the fluorescent ones because magnetofluorescence is easy to measure? From an engineering perspective, we're excited by the possibility that LOV-family proteins can be magnetically modulated, since they already form the foundation of so many successful optogenetic tools, and have already been "powered" via BRET

We only checked for magnetofluorescent response, but it would be extremely useful if LOV-family magnetoresponse also directly affected conformation or dimerization. Depending on the strength, sturdiness, and evolvability of GFP-family vs. LOV-family magnetoresponse, the LOV family may prove to be a compelling candidate ancestor for magnetogenetics.

We have determined that it is possible to modulate the fluorescence of GFP-like proteins using magnetic fields if we have the right cofactor. More over, and likely more impactful, is that we have demonstarted a path towards making a self contained probe using the FlavinTag that is biologically compatible. In this sense, what we have achieved has the potential to deliver the benefits of quantum measurements that have been proposed for nitrogen vacancies, but in a trully live cell/whole organism compatible fashion.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the fluorescence modulation is very small, and would also benefit from a faster respose rate. We have made single mutant libraries and observed that the effect is amenable to mutagenesis. Of course, it is easier to abolish the magnetic field response, and we have not yet succeeded at making a probe with larger modulation amplitude. However, the rate of the response seems easier to change, maybe due to different affinities for the cofactors. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, we suspect a radical pair mechanism, but further experiments to establish that this is indeed the case would be appropiate. In particular, experiments like finding the binding site for the cofactors, which can lead to more targeted optimization, are highly desirable. Also, determining what the response is at the single molecule level, under modulated and higher magnetic fields, and the effect of microwaves or radiowaves could lead to establishing EGFP-flavin as a probe for localization microscopy, NMR-like experiments, or ODMR-like experiments. 
</p>
It is tentalizeing to futher explore the possible applications of these types of probes. The fact that the rate of the fluorescence change in response to the magnetic field can be affected by mutagenesis suggests that it would be possible to perform single color multiplexing differentiating different FP mutants based on their response. 
-multiplexing, magnetogenetics, resolution, scattering media?
